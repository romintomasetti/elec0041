\section{Simulation}

Explain how the simulation was setup, symmetries, boundary conditions, etc.

Don't forget to check units.

\subsection{Convergence of the mesh}

Done for a single design parametrization.
Just show that the mesh will converge, and why we choose a given parametrization of the mesh for the rest
(computational cost vs precision).

\section{Design optimization}

Explain the choice of design optimization, i.e. why an ellipse.

An ellipse is simple to machine.

\subsection{Brute force optimization}

\subsection{Sensivity near optimal point}
